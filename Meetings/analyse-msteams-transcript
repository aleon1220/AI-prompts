<summary>💡 Comprehensive MS Teams Call Notes: Agenda-Based Summary and Follow-Up Planner 📚🤖🗂️</summary>

```text
You are given a transcript from a Microsoft Teams meeting. Generate detailed, structured meeting notes and a summary based solely on the transcript.

Important rules:

  Do not invent information that is not supported by the transcript.
  
  If you reasonably infer something (e.g., meeting title, roles), label it clearly as “(inferred)”.
  
  Maintain an objective, neutral tone.
  
  Be concise but complete on all essential points.
  
  Use clear headings and bullet points or numbered lists for readability.
  
  Proofread for grammar, spelling, and internal consistency.

1. Meeting Title
  Provide the meeting title or a concise description of the meeting’s purpose.
  
  If not explicitly stated, infer from context and label as “(inferred)”.

2. Date and Time
  Clearly indicate the date and time the meeting took place, if available.
  
  If not stated, write “Not specified in transcript”.

3. Agenda Items / Discussion Topics
  Organize the minutes by agenda item or major discussion topic.
  
  For each agenda item/topic, include:

  Title / Topic name
  
  Summary of discussion: key points raised.
  
  Decisions: clearly list any decisions made.
  
  Rationale / context (if relevant): brief explanation when it helps understanding.

4. Action Items
  List all concrete follow-ups. Include both explicit and carefully inferred action items.
  
  For each action item, specify:
  
  Action: what needs to be done.
  
  Owner: person responsible (or “Not specified”).
  
  Due date / timeframe: if mentioned (or “Not specified”).
  
  Source: mark as:
  
  [Explicit] if clearly stated as an action, or
  
  [Implicit] if reasonably inferred from the discussion. For implicit items, base them strictly on the transcript and avoid speculation.

5. Next Steps (from the meeting)
  Summarize any agreed next steps or follow‑on activities as stated in the meeting, such as:
  
  Planned follow-up meetings or checkpoints.
  
  Dependencies or prerequisites.
  
  Any open questions to be resolved.

6. Wrap-Up: Emphasis and Prioritization
  Provide a brief wrap-up that:
  
  Highlights the most critical action items (both explicit and implicit) and why they matter.
  
  Suggests prioritization (e.g., High / Medium / Low) based on the discussion in the transcript.
  
  Optionally provides a short, 2–3 sentence overall summary of meeting outcomes.
  
  Clearly distinguish between:
  
  Facts stated in the meeting, and
  
  Your prioritization or recommendations (label these as “recommendation”).

7. Appendix
7.1. Chat Highlights (if chat messages are part of the transcript)

  Summarize any important points, links, or decisions that appeared specifically in the chat (not already captured above).

7.2. Other Notes

  Include any additional details, clarifications, risks, or context that are important but do not fit neatly under the sections above.

7.3. Attendees

  List participants mentioned by name in the transcript.

  For each, note: Name, Role or affiliation, if specified (e.g., “Product Manager”, “Vendor”, “Customer X”).
  If roles are inferred from context, mark them as “(inferred)”.
  
  If the transcript does not list attendees, state: “Attendees not clearly specified in the transcript.”

Handling Long Transcripts (optional but recommended)
  If the transcript is long:

  Process it in logical sections (e.g., by speaker turns, time segments, or headings if provided).

  For each section, identify:

    Main topic(s)
    Key points
    Any decisions or actions
  Then consolidate these into the structured format above, avoiding repetition.
