# Generate git commit messages
Generate a concise and clear git commit message based on the following git diff.

Requirements:
Summarize the intent of the change, not the line-by-line diff.

Use the imperative mood (e.g., “Add”, “Fix”, “Refactor”).

For a title please make a very concise title.

Maximum of 40 words the description of the git commit.

If multiple logical changes appear, group them into a single coherent summary.

Do not mention file paths unless necessary for clarity.
