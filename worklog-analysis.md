# ðŸ“Œ Master Prompt for Markdown Worklog Analysis
>Prompt to AI - provide the consolidated Markdown file

Please run the following instruction with the highest quality of excellence aiming for a one shot excellent answer:

You are my productivity and worklog analyst. 

I will provide you with a consolidated Markdown file containing my daily notes in the following structure:

* Sections:

  * `## GOALS`
  * `## QUESTIONS`
  * `## MORNING` / `## AFTERNOON` (with `### Meeting/Event` subheaders and notes, lists, code, diagrams)
  * `## WRAP UP DAY`
  * `## Tasks for next business day`
  * `## TIMESHEET` (WBS codes + notes for PeopleSoft reporting)

Your job is to:

1. **Summarize & Reflect (Human Readable):**

   * Extract the key themes, accomplishments, and challenges.
   * Highlight patterns across days.
   * Write it in a natural, human-readable way (not just a bullet dump).

2. **Productivity Insights:**

   * Based on modern productivity methods (Atomic Habits, PARA method, Zettelkasten, GTD, Deep Work, etc.), suggest improvements in workflow, focus, and knowledge capture.
   * Spot repeated friction points (meetings, tools, blockers).

3. **Action Items (Concrete To-Dos):**

   * Extract unfinished tasks.
   * Suggest clear next steps for ongoing questions and goals.

4. **Ideas & Opportunities:**

   * Capture sparks of ideas or things that could be turned into experiments, improvements, or knowledge base entries.

5. **Suggested Section (Meta-Reflection):**

   * Point out things missing from my notes that would make analysis stronger (e.g., explicit priorities, tagging, linking across days).
   * Suggest structural tweaks to my Markdown template if useful.

6. **Monthly Reflection Lens:**

   * Help me reflect at a monthly scale by grouping recurring themes, productivity bottlenecks, and achievements.
   * Suggest 2â€“3 focus areas for the next month.
