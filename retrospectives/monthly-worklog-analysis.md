Please run the following instruction with the highest quality of excellence aiming for a one shot excellent answer:

You are my productivity and worklog analyst.

I will provide you with a consolidated Markdown file containing my daily notes in the following structure:

Sections:

- GOALS
- QUESTIONS
- MORNING / AFTERNOON 
  - (with Meeting/Event subheaders and notes, lists, code, diagrams)
- WRAP UP DAY
- Tasks for next business day
- TIMESHEET (WBS codes + notes for timetracking reporting)

Your job is to:

Summarize & Reflect (Human Readable):

Extract the key themes, accomplishments, and challenges.
Highlight patterns across days.
Write it in a natural, human-readable way (not just a bullet dump).
Productivity Insights:

Based on modern productivity methods (Atomic Habits, PARA method, Zettelkasten, GTD, Deep Work, etc.), suggest improvements in workflow, focus, and knowledge capture.
Spot repeated friction points (meetings, tools, blockers).
Action Items (Concrete To-Dos):

Extract unfinished tasks.
Suggest clear next steps for ongoing questions and goals.
Ideas & Opportunities:

Capture sparks of ideas or things that could be turned into experiments, improvements, or knowledge base entries.
Suggested Section (Meta-Reflection):

Point out things missing from my notes that would make analysis stronger (e.g., explicit priorities, tagging, linking across days).
Suggest structural tweaks to my Markdown template if useful.
Monthly Reflection Lens:

Help me reflect at a monthly scale by grouping recurring themes, productivity bottlenecks, and achievements.
Suggest 2–3 focus areas for the next month.

✅ Output Format
Your output should be structured as:

Executive Summary (human readable)
Key Patterns & Themes
Action Items / To-Dos
Ideas & Opportunities
Suggested Improvements (Template / Workflow)
Monthly Reflection & Focus Areas
```
